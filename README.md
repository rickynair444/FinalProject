# EMS Response Optimization Model

This web app assists citizens and hospital management teams to create optimized response times. 

Steps to run:

Before you start you have to run the following commands in your terminal: pip install flask, pip install sklearn, pip install xbgoost, pip install pandas, pip install numpy

First, you must make sure that 40kexpandedEMSData_withFakeData.csv is opening correctly

Then, you can open the train_testXGB.py file and run it

After this is completed, you can type python3 app.py which will create a localhost and launch the website

Lastly, go to http://localhost:5000

The above may be different for each user, but the link should be displayed in the terminal once app.py is run

Enjoy! Thank you.
